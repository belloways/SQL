--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into and I conducted analytics on the data using SQL.--

--Creating the table--
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.--

--What is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?-- 

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity), 
AVG (danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Which are the top 10 songs by popularity?--

SELECT DISTINCT (artist_name), track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Which artist released the song with the longest duration?--Result: Farruko at 287,120 ms (or 4.78 min).--
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

--On average, how many songs per artist are on the list?--Result: Approx. 1.42 songs per artist (50 songs/35 artists)--
SELECT COUNT (track_name)/COUNT(DISTINCT artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
