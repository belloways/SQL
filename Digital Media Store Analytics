--I downloaded a pre-existing database named 'chinook', which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.--
--I analyzed the data using multiple SQL queries below.--

--Show customers' full name, ID, and country who are not in the US.--
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

--Show only customers from Brazil.--
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--Find invoices of customers from Brazil.--
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices invoices
JOIN chinook.customers customers
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.customerId
WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

--Show employees who are sales agents.--
SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--Provide a unique/distinct list of billing countries.--
SELECT DISTINCT (BillingCountry)
FROM chinook.invoices;

--Provide invoices associated with each sales agent.--(I joined 3 tables via a junction table)--
SELECT invoices.invoiceid, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, employees.title
FROM chinook.invoices invoices

ON invoices.customerid = customers.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees employees

WHERE employees.title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--How many invocies were there in 2009?--
SELECT COUNT(*)

WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--What are the total sales for 2009?--
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--Provide purchased track name with each invoice line item.--
SELECT invoices.invoiceid, invoices.invoicelineid, tracks.name
FROM chinook.invoice_items invoices
JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
